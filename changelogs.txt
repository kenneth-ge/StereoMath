LOGISTICS
* ASSETS-- July
	* Poster-- talk about system design, iteratively co-design
	* Demo paper-- search ASSETS 2023 for posters/demo papers to see what that entails
* CHI-- September

DONE:
* Make parentheses shorter
* Announce op during auto insert
* Jump past the end of the text field (skip "Blank")
	* Use cursors
* Aria label for the sonification cue (parentheses)
	* Add option-- verbosity setting
* Parentheses-- mix volume so that we can convey the location of the parentheses
	* Same instrument but different notes?
		* E.g. VScode tree view-- open is one way, closing is another
		* Or like left parentheses (->) right parentheses (<-)
			* Maybe have audio move to the left and right
	* Conduct user studies in people and get their preference-- see what earcons can be easily associated with functionality. I.e. leave these as preferences that you can change
		* Sound theme/scheme
* Move reference tones to beginning-- i.e. instead of BEG, CUR, END => BEG, END, CUR
	* Option to only play range when the range changes
		* This would be helpful for telling if these things are aligned
* Implement review mode and edit mode
* Have option to read just the current node instead of just (CTRL + ALT + ]) for the whole thing
	* E.g. (CTRL + ALT + \)
		* ALT + SHIFT + [ for mathspeak
			* ALT + [ for mathspeak for current node
		* ALT + SHIFT + ] for intuitive readaloud
			* ALT + ] for intuitive readaloud for current node
* Put readaloud in text buffer after pressing (CTRL + ALT + [) or (CTRL + ALT + ]) twice
	* Aka put it in a read-only text field popup dialog window in HTML
* Text field: add 'role="application"'
	* Children will inherit from parent
* Have spatial keyboard correspond to size/width of equation, rather than width of screen
* A complicated equation has rows and columns, can we reference the beginning/end of the row or the beginning/end of the column instead?
	* Think of equation as a table
	* Add this as an extra configuration-- end of column, end of row, end of entire equation
	* One key to cycle between these modes
* Make spatial nav sounds shorter
* Say the contents of the field after navigating somewhere spatially
* Loading feature? Ability to read/write equations
* Change row/col spatial behavior to cycle between using CTRL + ESC


WAITING:
* Is this new behavior with the navigation and parentheses confusing?
	* I just feel like fundamentaly an equation editor is different behavior and *shouldn't* act just like any other linear text editor, because it's fundamentally *not* linear. The whole point is automatic completion, and having "blank"s there is a better representation (and arguably more intuitive). Also, for sighted users this is how the experience is... luckily, I can change it with one setting change
* Create sample equations using audio scheme
	* E.g. testing reading vs just writing
		* To test our audio/reviewing scheme
		* Test against the baseline
		* Introduce 2-3 conditions, test against
			E.g. JAWS MathViewer, linear, etc. 
		* Ask them to describe the equation-- "what do you think te spatial layout looks like..."
			* Accuracy, preference, etc. 
	* Using experiment to justify design choice
* Should we use a shortcut/special case for associative operators?
	* Upside: simpler and makes more sense, e.g. (a + b + c) = ((a + b) + c) = (a + (b + c))
	* Downside: what if you want to break it up in the middle? Editing becomes harder, because:
		(a + b + c) => ((a + b) / 5) + c is much harder to do
			But then again, if you have (a + (b + c)), it's hard to do here as well
	* Basically, how should we handle associative operators and stuff? E.g. should we allow people to select multiple fields at once? Or even multiple nodes etc.?

TO DO:
* Kill synth sound if user presses another spatial position?
* Question: How do other blind folks digest spatial audio?
* Features for later:
	* Implement tables
	* CTRL + Z for undo
	* Removing unnecessary parentheses?
	* Associative operators?



Before 5/7

DONE
* Change insert key
* Unlabeled button
* Insert mode vs navigation
	* Change to toggle
* Fix going all the way left readaloud
	* Change sound for going all the way left
* Fix deleting on input field
* Get LaTeX-- copy to clipboard
* Navigate through internal symbols (e.g. plus)
* Full readaloud not working
* Make sure to read inbetween symbols in e.g. this case: (a - b) * (c - d)
	* Right now it skips the *
* Why isn't it reading char by char?
* Preserve input size
* Visualize keyboard navigation
* Fix bug with backspace in navigation mode
* Automatic insertion for text fields
* Automatically do minus, plus, fraction, etc. 
* Automatic insertion for groupings/separators

WAITING
* See why not reading aloud
* Change to separate key combination or button to read the whole expression
* Keep same audio for beginning vs end, but use different spatial orientation
* Associative operators

NOT DONE
* Limit to either left/right or up/down
	* Up/down should read the field
* Read aloud with feedback--
	* When navigating spatially-- provide some context (e.g. right before or right after)


* What is a unit or item?
	* Numerator or denominator are items
		* Fraction is a "vector"
	* Unit-- anything that is not an input field in our tree
* "Node and field"
	* When you navigate spatially:
* Two types of spatial navigation: 2D spatial navigation in the actual physical representation, vs left/rightness in the tree (i.e. how many nodes are to the right/left)

* Make two demos-- one that tells you how many nodes to left/right based on tree, and one that just reads things that are directly to the left and right (we can try to spatial audio for that?)
	* For telling you left/rightedness, use piano (e.g. C3 (min) C4 (max) E3 (where you are))
